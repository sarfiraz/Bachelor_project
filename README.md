# Laravel Project Setup and Running Guide
This guide will walk you through the steps necessary to set up and run a Laravel project on your local machine.

## Requirements
Before proceeding, make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- PHP (version 8.2 or higher)
- Composer
- MySQL
- Git
- or if you have xammp it has all of them in it

## Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone command:

```sh
git clone <repository-url>
```
### Install the project dependencies using Composer:
```sh
composer install
```

### Generate an application key using the following command:

php artisan key:generate
```

### Run the database migrations:
```sh  
php artisan migrate
```
  
## Running the Application
You can start the development server using the following command:
```sh
php artisan serve
```
Once the server is running, you can access your application by navigating to http://localhost:8000 in your web browser.

## Conclusion
